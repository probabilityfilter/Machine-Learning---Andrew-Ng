Throughout the exercise, you will be using the scripts ex2.m and ex2 reg.m.
These scripts set up the dataset for the problems and make calls to functions
that you will write. You do not need to modify either of them. You are only
required to modify functions in other les, by following the instructions in
this assignment.
