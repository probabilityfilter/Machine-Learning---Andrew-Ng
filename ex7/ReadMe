? indicates les you will need to complete
Throughout the rst part of the exercise, you will be using the script
ex7.m, for the second part you will use ex7 pca.m. These scripts set up the
dataset for the problems and make calls to functions that you will write.
You are only required to modify functions in other les, by following the
instructions in this assignment.
