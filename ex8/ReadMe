? indicates les you will need to complete
Throughout the rst part of the exercise (anomaly detection) you will be
using the script ex8.m. For the second part of collaborative ltering, you
will use ex8 cofi.m. These scripts set up the dataset for the problems and
make calls to functions that you will write. You are only required to modify
functions in other les, by following the instructions in this assignment.
